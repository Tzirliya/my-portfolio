      <h2>Mandelbrot Set</h2>
      <p>Out of curiousity, I challenged myself to program a Mandelbrot set. I researched 
        the math behind the Mandelbrot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">
        here</a>, but I did not reference any code to create it. Below are some images created 
        by different versions of the Mandelbrot sets I programmed.
      </p>

      <h2>Animated Swirl</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8">This video</a> inspired me 
        to recreate the spiral shown at the end of the video. Within the animation, a rounded 
        heart shape can be seen. This shape is nicknamed the heart of mathematics. My animation 
        was first created only a few weeks into my first Computer Science course. My professor 
        found it impressive and encouraged me to create a spirograph simulation as my semester 
        project (found on the main page). <!--Below is a clip of the animation in action.-->

      <h2>Solve Differential Equations Using Numerical Methods</h2>
      <p>I created a program that, given a differential equation on a range, it can solve and 
        graph approximate solutions using three methods: Euler's method, the improved Euler's 
        method, and the Runge-Kutta method. Each of these methods can be given a step-size h, to 
        determine the accuracy of these approximation methods. I graphed the solutions using 
        matplotlib, a Python module. Below is a sample of output produced by my program.

      <h2>Compare Time of Prim's vs. Kruskall's Algorithm</h2>
      <p>Together with a classmate, we compared the time to run Prim's algorithm and 
        Kruskall's algorithm on graphs of various sizes and densities. We came to the 
        conclusion that Prim's algorithm gets significantly slower on larger graphs, but 
        doesn't react as much to increased density. However, Kruskall's algorithm reacts to 
        density more than size. We found that Kruskall's algorith has the largest advantage \
        on larger sparser graphs. We ran these algorithms on ten randomized graphs and 
        graphed the results below. (In the graph on the right, larger circles mean longer time.)
