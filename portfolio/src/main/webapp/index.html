      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I was born in 1999. I was raised in Brooklyn, NY. I was always interested in math from a 
        young age. When I was thirteen, I began to learn math online. It was there that I first 
        discovered coding. I began to teach myself the basics of JavaScript. It was around that age 
        that I also began to become interested in science. I loved watching documentaries about 
        Quantum Physics. My first Computer Science course was in college. I loved the subject and 
        decided to become a CS major. Outside of coding, I enjoy walking, cooking, and practicing 
        piano and violin. </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I went to Beis Rivkah Elementary School and Beis Rivkah High School in Brooklyn, NY. After 
        high school, I took a gap year to study Judaic studies in Israel at Seminary Chaya Mushka. 
        I'm currently a student in Yeshiva University studying Computer Science. So far, I've taken 
        the following courses: Data Stuctures, Object-Oriented Software Design, Applied 
        Linux, Algorithms, Database Systems, and Programming Languages. I'm also minoring in 
        math. So far I've taken the following math courses: Calculus I and II, Multivariable Calculus, 
        Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra.
