        <p>Since I was nine years old, I've taken piano lessons for most years of my life. Less than two 
          years ago, I bought a ukulele and violin and proceded to teach it to myself. Now I love 
          practicing all three instruments as a hobby. Recently, I've tried to compose my own music. Classical 
          music inspires me most, as that's what I love listening to.

        <p>Around two years ago, I decided that I needed to learn how to cook. I began with frying 
          because I was able to see the food cooking in front of me, so I knew that I wouldn't 
          undercook or burn anything. I then branched off into other forms of cooking and I even 
          dabbled in baking. Now I enjoy making all types of food. My favorite part is eating it!

        <p>I've always enjoyed going for long walks. One summer, I went to a three-week hiking and 
          camping camp where we lived in tents, hiked many trails, and had lengthy bus journeys 
          along the Rocky Mountains in the US. After high school, I took a gap year in Israel where 
          I went on many hikes. My favorite hike was one where I walked down a mountain, passed some 
          streams of water, and climbed up a nearby mountain into a neighboring city. I did that hike 
          five times! Currently, I live in New York, and sadly there aren't too many hikes nearby, so 
          I enjoy walking in parks instead.

        <p>It's fun to travel and find adventures hidden around the world. Although I haven't traveled 
          to many places yet, they're definitely on my bucket list. Below is a map of my travels. The 
          green pins are places I've been to, and the purple pins are places I'd like to visit in the future.

        <p>When I was a child, my mom bought me a Rubik's cube and handed me a book that included 
          the algorithms to solve it. I promptly memorized the steps and was able to solve it 
          from memory. Years later, I forgot the algorithms until a friend taught them to me. Now 
          I love to solve all different types of Rubik's cubes. They range in different sizes and 
          shapes. Over the past few years, my collection has grown to over ten different types of 
          cubes.
